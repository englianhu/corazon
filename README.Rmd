# corazon

`corazon` allows you to incorporate easily [colorffy](https://www.colorffy.com/gradients/catalog) gradient colors within Shiny elements though it is principally designed for the app's body.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `corazon` from Github with: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}

install.packages("remotes")  # If not installed 

remotes::install_github("feddelegrand7/corazon")



```



## Examples

# IMPORTANT: The gradients won't be applied if you leave your shiny application empty !!!


By default `corazon` applies the color gradient on the body of your shiny app: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(corazon)

ui <- fluidPage(

corazon_gradient(colorName = "PINEAPPLE", txtColor = "#1ED760"),

h1("This is a Title"),

)

server <- function(input, output) {}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

```

How do you find the gradient colors' names ? 

+ You can run `available_gradients()`: this will return a data frame of the available gradient colors' names along with their respective hex codes. 

+ You can visit the [colorffy](https://www.colorffy.com/gradients/catalog) website where you can find a catalog of the gradient colors. Just copy the names and paste them within the `corazon_gradient()` function. 



You can incorporate gradients within many (not all) shiny element. You just need to prefix the shiny element's Id with a `#`: 


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(corazon)

ui <- fluidPage(
corazon_gradient(colorName = "LOVE"),
corazon_gradient(element = "#txt", colorName = "PEACH", txtColor = "#4E5C68"),
corazon_gradient(element = "#txt2", colorName = "ROYAL", txtColor = "#4E5C68"), 
corazon_gradient(element = "#btn", colorName = "COOL", txtColor = "#4E5C68"), 
corazon_gradient(element = "#dbtn", colorName = "JUICE", txtColor = "#4E5C68"),
corazon_gradient(element = "#ninp", colorName = "CYBER", txtColor = "#4E5C68"),
corazon_gradient(element = "#date", colorName = "MELOCOTON", txtColor = "#4E5C68"),




h1("This is a Title"),

textAreaInput(inputId = "txt", 
              label = "This is textAreaInput ",
              height = "300px",
              width = "300px"),

textInput(inputId = "txt2", label = "This is a textInput"), 

actionButton(inputId = "btn", label = "this is an actionButton"), 

downloadButton(outputId = "dbtn", label = "This is a downloadButton"),

br(), br(),

numericInput(inputId = "ninp", label = "This is a numericInput", 
             min = 0, max = 100, value = 10, step = 1), br(), 

shiny::dateInput(inputId = "date", label = "This is a dateInput")





)

server <- function(input, output) {}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

```
